      <p>Hi, I’m Kevin Finlayson. I’m a Montréal-based designer. I specialize in visual and interaction design, mostly for web and screen-based media. I’m also a skilled front-end developer, with some full-stack experience. Which is to say: I design and build websites.</p>

      <p>From 2006-2012 I freelanced under the name <a href="http://dustandmold.net" title="Dust and Mold Design">Dust and Mold Design</a>. I was honoured to work with clients that included Mozilla, Warner Music Canada, MetaLab Design, Paper Bag Records, Last Gang Entertainment and many others.</p>

      <p>Since 2012 I’ve been a designer at Pixel Union, MetaLab Design’s digital product team. My theme designs for Shopify and Tumblr have been licensed by organizations I respect and admire, such as Tesla Motors, N+1, Rdio, The Today Show, The LA Lakers and The Manual.</p>

      <p>My background is in fine arts, specifically drawing and print media. I have an MFA from Concordia University (Montréal, 2005), and a BFA from York University (Toronto, 2002), where I also studied film, literature, critical theory, and Japanese (I was fluent—barely—for a short time). I played drums in jazz and hardcore bands, recording and touring throughout the US and Europe, but gave it up to go back to art school.</p>

      <p>I’m fascinated with design, technology and human-computer interaction, and see interaction design as a kind of interpretive layer between users and new, unfamiliar technologies. I’m primarily invested in exploring what makes an interface truly delightful to use.

      <p>Outside of design, I’m into running and fitness. On the weekends, my girlfriend and I like to cook, trying out new dishes and unfamiliar cuisines.</p>
