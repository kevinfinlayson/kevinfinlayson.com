      <p>I’m a designer based in Montreal, Canada. I design and build web products and strategies for some amazing clients, including Metalab Design, Fieldsound, Mozilla, Warner Music Canada and Paper Bag Records.</p>
      <p>I’m into a lot of things. These days mostly winter running, Moby Dick, ‘emotional’ design, pour-over coffee and my new apartment.</p>
      <p>Feel free to check out my stream-of-consciousness on Twitter, my timeline on Facebook, some work samples on Dribbble, bits of inspiration on Gimme Bar, and my photos on Flickr.</p>
