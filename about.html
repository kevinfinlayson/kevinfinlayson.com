      <p>Hi, I’m Kevin Finlayson. I’m a Montréal-based designer. I specialize in visual and interaction design, mostly for web and screen-based media. I’m also a capable front-end developer, with some full-stack experience.</p>

      <p>From 2006-2012 I freelanced under the name <a href="http://dustandmold.net" title="Dust and Mold Design">Dust and Mold Design</a>. My clients included Mozilla,  Warner Music Canada, MetaLab Design, Paper Bag Records, Last Gang Entertainment and many others.</p>

      <p>Since 2012 I’ve been a designer at Pixel Union, MetaLab Design’s digital product team. My theme designs for Shopify and Tumblr have been licensed by companies like Tesla Motors, N+1, Rdio, the Today Show, the LA Lakers and The Manual.</p>

      <p>My background is in fine arts, specifically drawing and print media. I have an MFA from Concordia University (Montréal, 2005), and a BFA from York University (Toronto, 2002), where I also studied film, literature, critical theory, and Japanese. I used to play drums in jazz and hardcore bands, recording and touring throughout the US and Europe.</p>

      <p> Now I’m mostly into design, front-end development, typography, running, cooking, and baseball.</p>
