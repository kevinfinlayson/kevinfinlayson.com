      <p>I’m a designer based in Montreal, Canada. I design interfaces and products, mostly for the web. Past and present clients include MetaLab Design, Fieldsound, Mozilla, Warner Music Canada and Paper Bag Records. You can find out more at my studio website, <a href="http://dustandmold.net" title="dustandmold.net">dustandmold.net</a>.</p>

      <p>I came to design indirectly, having studied art in secondary school and university, eventually achieving a Master’s degree in Fine Arts with an emphasis on print media. I also studied film, literature, critical theory, and Japanese, gaining basic fluency in 2001 (and losing it shortly thereafter).</p>

      <p>I’m an informally retired musician, having played drums in small jazz ensembles in secondary school, and <a href="http://rd.io/x/QJDIPkRNKQ" title="Grade - Separate The Magnets">recording and touring with bands</a> in the DIY hardcode punk scene in the 1990s. This was an exciting time in my life and I was lucky enough to meet and share a stage with many of my musical idols, from Oscar Peterson to Ian Mackaye.</p>

      <p>Now I live and work in Mile End with my girlfriend, filmmaker <a href="http://karablake.com" title="Kara Blake">Kara Blake</a>. Aside from living and breathing design, typography, and the web, I’m a devoted runner. I also like whiskey and try not to use an alarm clock.</p>
