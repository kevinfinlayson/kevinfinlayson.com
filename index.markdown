title: Design leader and product generalist
---

Hey there! I’m a design leader who thrives when leading teams at the complex intersection of people, technology and business. The peak of my career has been leading design for the most critical parts of the Shopify platform, including Online Store, Checkout, Orders Management, Fulfillment, Inventory and many more. 

I believe great product design is cultivated through a deep, reflexive empathy for the user, exhaustive attention to detail, and an unwavering focus on shipping value quickly and sustainably.

As a leader my superpower is bringing a sense of stability, focus and drive to teams shipping complex products in volatile market and industry conditions.

Get in touch, check out my about page, read more about my design and leadership philosophy, or check out some case studies from my time at Shopify.
