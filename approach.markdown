#### Leadership Philosophy

I believe that people are inherently intelligent, talented, driven, and want to do something meaningful with their time and energy. The job of the leader is to leverage this drive and desire, to help individuals stretch and grow and realize their potential, coming together in aggregate to do great things as a team. 

Being a great leader is not about being the smartest and most impactful person in the room, it’s about creating rooms of fully realized, highly engaged people doing the best work of their lives together, being fulfilled and having fun in the process.

A great product leader does not stay at a high level of altitude, simply coaching and mentoring. They’re highly visible, responsive, and close to the product. The best leaders I worked with were always available, always quick to respond and help unblock their teams.

I believe a great leader is able to get more from their teams by recognizing and cultivating unique individual greatness, by creating a safe, trusting and sustainable work environment, and by inspiring team members to come together and create something greater than themselves.



#### Unordered thoughts on product design

I have lots of opinions about design, tools, collaboration and so on. Here are a few:

- The design process is primarily a tool for driving alignment to enable building and shipping.

- We risk losing our customers' good will and business at every moment. Radical empathy and a focus on what customers want and need is paramount.

- There is a threshold at which our understanding of a problem is exhausted and a solution cannot be evaluated without putting it in contact with reality.

- The goal is to accelerate the expansion of the knowledge of the problem towards this threshold. Product review is not about selling a design to stakeholders, but leveraging their context and experience to this end.

- The user is intelligent and should be treated as such.

- A project will ship more quickly and have a greater chance of success if designers work proactively with all other disciplines throughout the project life cycle.

- Tools and artifacts are important only to the extent that they enable us to ship product and maintain that product for the long term.

- A new feature is poison if it introduces a UX regression. This happens with alarming frequency on many products we use every day.

- Design should reveal or obscure the underlying complexity of the product to the extent that it helps meet the needs of the customer.

- Do not by paralyzed trying to account for edge cases. As long as you are shipping real value on the green path with no regressions, it is a win.

- Your design should always have an opinion about what is best for the customer.

- There is almost always a simpler and more elegant way of briging real value to the customer. We should ask how we could ship the thing in a few weeks, or a single cycle, rather than in months or next year.

- MVP does not mean a partial feature shipped quickly, nor does it mean a complete feature shipped poorly. A good MVP is a polished first step that brings value while outlining the promise of what’s to come.

- UI is closely connected with how data transforms as it moves through the product. Designers should understand the data model, the key mutations for the feature, and the business implications of how and where the data is stored.

- Performance is one of the most significant lifts to user experience that a team can ship, but the impediments are often cultural and organizational rather than technical.
