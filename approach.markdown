#### Leadership Philosophy

I believe that people are inherently smart, talented and driven, and want to do something meaningful with their time and energy. The job of a leader is to help individuals leverage this drive and desire, to help them stretch and grow and realize their potential.

A great product leader does not stay at a high level of altitude, simply coaching and mentoring. They’re visible, responsive, and close to the product. The best leaders I’ve worked with were always available, quick to respond and help unblock their teams.

It’s this kind of leader that is able to get more from their teams. They do this by recognizing and cultivating unique individual greatness, by creating a safe, trusting and sustainable work environment, and by inspiring team members to come together and create something greater than themselves.

I aspire to be this kind of leader. I’m considered to be a calm, thoughtful and empathetic presence. I’m good at understanding people and reading tricky situations. I believe in letting teams own what they work on, but that it's my job to stay close, sharpen thinking, clear up ambiguity, and ultimately hold the team accountable for what they release into the world.

#### On product design

A few medium-held opinions, lots more where these come from:

- The customer is intelligent and should be treated as such.

- The design process is a tool for driving alignment on what to build and ship.

- Your design should always have an opinion about what is best for the customer.

- Ask yourself: does my design bring more value than a CSV upload? If not, why not?

- Designers should work continuously with their partner disciplines starting as early in the product life cycle as possible.

- Tools and artifacts are a distant second to the knowledge they help uncover and capture.

- Good product design obscures the underlying system only to the extent that the customer is aided in what they are trying to accomplish.

- There is almost always a simpler way of doing the thing. Ask yourself how you could ship in days or weeks rather than months.

- A good MVP brings value to the customer while outlining the promise of what’s to come.
