#### Leadership Philosophy

I believe that people are inherently smart, talented and driven, and want to do something meaningful with their time and energy. The job of a leader is to help individuals leverage this drive and desire, to help them stretch and grow and realize their potential.

A great product leader does not stay at a high level of altitude, simply coaching and mentoring. They’re visible, responsive, and close to the product. The best leaders I’ve worked with were always available, quick to respond and help unblock their teams.

It’s this kind of leader that is able to get more from their teams. They do this by recognizing and cultivating unique individual greatness, by creating a safe, trusting and sustainable work environment, and by inspiring team members to come together and create something greater than themselves.

I aspire to be this kind of leader. I’m considered to be a calm, thoughtful and empathetic presence. I’m good at understanding people and reading tricky situations. I believe in letting teams own what they work on, but that it's my job to stay close, clarify ambiguity, and keep the team inspired, engaged and shipping with a healthy sense of urgency.

#### On product design

A few medium-held opinions:

- The customer is intelligent and should be treated as such.

- Design is underused as a tool for driving alignment and decision making.

- Your design should be opinionated but not rigid.

- Designers and developers aren't working together early enough in the process.

- The point of a prototype is the knowledge it captures, not the artifact itself.

- Ask yourself how you could ship in days or weeks rather than months.

- A good MVP is both a high quality value add and a promise of what's to come.
