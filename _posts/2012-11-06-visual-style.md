In web and UI design, I find it alarmingly common to hear my peers speak in absolutes. This especially when it comes to visual style. Shifts in the tastes of designers and users feel like a rigid linear narrative, with only the most recently popularized style held in esteem or considered appropriate for the design challenge at hand.

I’ve watched this cycle a few times now. Glossy ‘web 2.0’ styles were replaced by ‘wicked-worn’, which in turn was subsumed by iOS-style design, which is now being derided as inferior to ‘flat design’ and Windows 8 (Metro-style) UI. And now there’s a backlash against skeumorphism and real-world metaphor, one that’s been central to a recent leadership shake-up at Apple.

But all these styles hold a place in what I consider to be an emerging constellation of visual language. A designer should strive to be conversant, if not skilled, in many or all of these styles. No one is inherently better than another, but some may be more appropriate for the requirements of the project at hand.

If you wish to work in a specific style, align yourself with projects for which the style in question is the absolute ideal. however, there’s always the risk when working entirely within one’s comfort zone that you may not grow as a designer.

The only label you need to bother with is the one that describes this process of understanding what you’re building, whom it’s for, and what the best possible outcome is. As for skeumorphism, I believe Robert Anderson, designer at Square, sums its place and value nicely with this tweet:
