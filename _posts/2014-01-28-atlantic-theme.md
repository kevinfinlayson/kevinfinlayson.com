When I saw that Pixel Union’s [Atlantic Theme](https://www.pixelunion.net/themes/shopify/atlantic/) was front-and-center in Shopify’s [2013 Year in Review](http://shopify.com/2013#platform), I realized I hadn’t posted about it when we launched the theme earlier this year.

I had the pleasure of designing Atlantic, which has proved to be one of our best-selling themes. Our goal was to create a responsive theme that feels crisp, contemporary and sexy, like the Mr. Porter shop.

We also wanted the theme to include delightful features and details that would emerge as customers go about the shopping experience. These include the rolling ‘mega-nav’, the minicart, the quick-shop feature, the sumptuous product pages, and many others.

I’m especially proud of the blog layout, and how elegant it looks at difference viewport widths and on different devices.

Atlantic was even used by [Goodwin and Goodwin](http://www.goodwinandgoodwin.com) for their award-winning entry in the Shopify [Ecommerce Design Awards](http://www.shopify.ca/design-awards), and was praised by contest judge and famed web designer and publisher Jeffrey Zeldman as having a clear hierarchy and well-considered typography throughout, as well as clean and elegant responsiveness.
