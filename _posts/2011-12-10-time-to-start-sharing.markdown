From time to time, I like to write things. I’ll get excited or incensed about something, and find I have more to say than 140 characters will permit.

Not that I’m without options, in this golden age of self-publishing. A quick flip through my mental platform rolodex has me considering the options available, options which will get me from ‘Point A’ (burning with unexpressed insight) to ‘Point B’ (sated and heavy-lidded after articulately firehosing anyone in web-earshot with my wisdom and learnedness).

I consider Tumblr—setting up a quick account with one of Carlo Franco’s excellent themes (such as http://effectortheme.tumblr.com)—but then I start thinking of my own design, and then I start prototyping, and then…I lose interest.

Lately, I’ve also been considering Google plus for this kind of medium-length tirade. Some have made this work as a quick-and-dirty posting venue for ideas not fleshed out into full blog posts (Oliver Recheinstein, for example). But I want something more curated, more elegant.

So I’ve decided to go with Jekyll. Flat files, markdown, lemon squeezy. This may evolve into a fuller website with a portfolio of my works. I may complete one of those Tumblr themes and augment these pieces with photosets, videos and the like. We’ll see. But for now: one column, tons of whitespace, and YAML.
