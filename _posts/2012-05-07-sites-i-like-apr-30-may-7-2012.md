There’ve been some remarkable site lauches and redesigns this week. First up is the new marketing site for music streaming service [Rdio](http://rdio.com).

I like what they’re going for here, with flat areas of colour and negative space devoid of texture, a great sense of vertical rhythm and colour balance, and a very effective use of [Freight Sans UC](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/garagefonts/freight-sans/), all in keeping with some of the UI ideas we saw with the blog redesign last year.

Among the many nice UI ideas, I particularly like the ‘millions of songs’ section, below the ‘supported device area’, which functions as a kind of inside-out, non-sliding coverflow viewer.

My only criticism is the marquee slideshow on the front page. The photos look like they’re straight out of [Dwell Magazine](http://www.dwell.com/) (what’s with that fume hood?), and lack the engaging visual complexity that an array of album cover art would provide. We have to scroll down to the impactful ‘songs’ section to get this.
