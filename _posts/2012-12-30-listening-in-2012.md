## A Return to Vinyl

The biggest development in music for me, in 2012, wasn’t related to a specific release or artist. I’ve been [increasingly troubled](http://kevinfinlayson.com/2012/09/13/rdio/) by the fact that artist’s aren’t getting adequate, proportional pay for streaming services like Rdio and Spotify, so I’ve started to make a conscious effort to pay for music. I’ve been circling the new releases bin at our [very fine neighbourhood record store](http://www.phonopolis.ca) for weeks, purchasing a couple of used records here and there, but Kara opened the floodgates by buying me the PJ Harvey record for Christmas. I forgot how much fun vinyl is, how great it sounds, and how investing money in an object makes you give it more attention and consideration.
