[Rdio’s](http://rdio.com "Rdio") Facebook integration has been serving me well as a record of my recent listening trends, but it only really represents half of the music I’ve been into so far this year. I thought I’d mention a few of the records that are really doing it for me right now.

    ##Grimes - Visions##

  The electro-pop of Montréal’s Claire Boucher matured abruptly with her full-length debut on 4AD. It’s catchy, intricate, and rewards repeat listens. The cover art is great too, like a hybridized Japanese interpretation of late-80s skate-culture graphic design.
