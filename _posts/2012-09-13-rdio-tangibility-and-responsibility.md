title: On Rdio, Tangibility, and Responsibility
---

Last night, Rob Weychert, he of impressive beard and air guitar championship record, [published a post](http://robweychert.com/writing/year-of-rdio/) on his year of using music discovery/streaming service [Rdio](http://rdio.com). I’m inclined to offer some thoughts as well, because it’s been over a year for me, and my experience has been somewhat different from Rob’s.

The gist of Rob’s piece is that in the past year, while he’s listened to a huge amount of music, he’s devoted less time to specific records. He’s accustomed to the obligation of a concrete purchase to spur him to give albums a chance, over repeat listens. That lack of investment, time-wise and emotionally, translated into fewer instances of actual purchase.

My experience has been markedly different. I have always listened to full albums, not songs. I never got into playlists or shuffling. I like the arc of an album, the larger scope and canvas for exploration and storytelling, the potential for variations in mood, tone and intensity. Rdio didn’t change this.

What also hasn’t changed is my investment in individual albums. I don’t just put a lot of different songs or albums the queue and let it play in the background. I listen actively, I put albums, sometimes clusters of albums, on repeat. If I get bored of a record in a few listens, then I move on—I like records that yield more the more you invest in them.

Some further points about how I use Rdio:

**Discovery**: I don’t rely exclusively on Rdio for discovery. At any given time, my network’s ‘Heavy Rotation’, based on Rdio’s own recent releases, can be a bit thin. Many albums I’m excited about don’t show up for weeks or months after official release. Add to this the fact that most of my network is comprised of tech and web people, who don’t necessarily have the same tastes that I do. So what do I use for discovery? In addition to Rdio, I rely on [Boomkat](http://boomkat.com), [Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com), recommendations from friends (on Facebook and off), [Soundcloud](http://soundlcoud.com), [The Wire magazine](http://www.thewire.co.uk/), and so on.

**The Classics**: I rely on Rdio for classics—jazz, soul, classical music, you name it. This is where the service really shines—it has a tremendous catalogue that I could never dream of matching with iTunes purchases. I don’t feel so badly about not paying for each album individually, because many of these artists have passed on, although recent releases in these genres have the same raw deal as any other.

**I Still use iTunes**: Rdio really only has about 70% of the music I want to listen to. so I find myself firing up iTunes quite frequently. This week alone, I’ve used it to listen to Andy Stott, Wolves in the Throne Room, Helm, N.Racker, and Prurient. None of these albums in question are on Rdio, at least not for my region.

In the end, I’m not sure that Weychert’s observations of how Rdio has changed his listening habits can be held as a criticism of the service. There’s an obligation on the user to fit a service into their lives in a way that adds value. I see this as not dissimilar as Facebook users blaming the service for a superficial level of engagement with their friends, as Twitter being blamed for the downfall of blogging, for Instagram being reponsible for a glut of bad photography. A service in and of itself does not dictate how you use it, does not require you to change your behaviour. It can can facilitate laziness or irresponsibility, often by removing necessary friction, but ultimately it’s on you.

On the other hand, Weychert raises a troubling point related to consumer responsibility, and how music subscription services effectively let users off the hook. I’ve been increasingly bothered by the fact that the artists I listen to through Rdio are getting a [raw deal](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2010/how-much-do-music-artists-earn-online/), not being adequately paid for the music.

There’s a line of thinking that suggests that live shows are no longer used to promote albums and drive sales, but that there’s been a reversal, and music is now freely distributed to draw and concert audiences and sell tickets. This seems alien to someone like me, a huge shift from my early days of music collecting (of paying $30 for a single ‘import’ CD from a record label based in the very city I was purchasing it, or of going to shows to buy rare releases limited edition releases from distro bins), but I’m not sure it has to be one way or the other.

Part of the trouble is tangibility. $10 per album seems like a lot of money for some digital files. I have a turntable, but I’m increasingly loathe to buy actual objects, even though that would psychologically offset the expense, and solve the tangibility problem.

This has gotten me thinking. How much do my partner and I spend on Rdio in a year? About $240 (we have a family account). How many records do I really get invested in, in the course of a year? In 2011, it’s safe to say about 12-15 albums really stuck. I could pay for each of those records for about the cost of a year of Rdio, would own the files, and will have supported the artists in the process. I’m not suggesting that I leave Rdio. I love the service and want to support it. And frankly, I’d hate to lose access to the huge catalogue of classical/jazz/etc. At the same time, those numbers are kind of eye-opening.

Here’s a thought. What if Rdio gently suggested consumers purchase a record, once they hit a certain play count? Make it opt in and let users set the threshold. The occasional purchase of a record that I’ve demonstrably enjoyed would help me feel better about using the service in general.
