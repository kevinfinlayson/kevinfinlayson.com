Montréal’s Claire Boucher (a.k.a. [Grimes](http://www.grimesmusic.com "Grimes")) has been on my radar for about a year now, with a few collaborations popping up on small indie imprints through 2010 and 2011. These records were good, but felt tentative‚ as though Ms. Boucher was still figuring out the medium.

With **Visions**, her [full-length album on 4AD](http://4ad.com/releases/21498 "Full-length album on 4AD"), Grimes appears to have to matured abruptly, hitting her stride with a record that’s remarkably consistent and absording. It’s catchy and intricate, and expertly folds a range of sub-genres and styles into a wholly unique-sounding package.

  The cover art is great too, like a hybridized Japanese interpretation of late-80s skate-culture graphic design.
