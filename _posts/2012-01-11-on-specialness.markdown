Frank‘s writing always makes me feel better. I feel comforted by his optimism, by his humane worldview. But I don’t always agree with him. Sometimes, he gets going on an idea, and it feels like he’s just off course—heading 11'0 clock when he should be going straight ahead. 

This doesn’t mean he’s wrong and that I’m right, or vice-versa. In fact, this is maybe how thoughtful writing should function: it should be dissonant, to make us consider our positions, to evaluate its tack and our own.

In his essay ‘The Spaces Between Us’, in issue #1 of The Manual, Frank comes to the conclusion—or rather, one of the characters in the piece, do—that humans just want to be understood. This doesn’t sit well with me.

I’ve rarely felt frustrated about being misunderstood. Certainly there are communication issues from time-to-time, and when I was younger and less secure in who I was, this played a part in my life. But the statement on the whole made me think ‘If being understood isn’t a central part of who I am, and what motives me—what could be that singular impulse’.

For me, I can’t help but think that it’s Specialness. i was raised being reminded, constantly, how special I am. This sometimes to such an extent that it felt distorted; special food  at birthdays, special consideration at school, and so on. And in one of those predictable reversals probably rooted in the capriciousness of human insecurity, desire and self-understandind, that simply made me hungrier for Specialness. I mean sure, I was special back then, but what about now? What about _at this_?

I’ve been in a cycle of mastery my whole life—getting good at something, gaining some attention and noteriety, and then moving on to something. I used to think my hobby was mastery, but it’s something more than that, something almost compulsive. I’m being dramatic, but the unending treadmill, trap, of my life, would appear to be the desire for recognition.

At some point, it might be a good idea think about that, to consider if that’s enough, if that’s the thing I want to be driving me through this life. What if I stopped trying to be recognized as special, and just threw myself into the things at hand. My relationships, my work, my enjoyment of life—for the sake of what they are, for the sake of doing them. To enjoy, to provide, to support, and to love.
