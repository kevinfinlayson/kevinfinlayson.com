title: Some Thoughts on Applied Discovery
---

In his insightful talk from Build 2013,  available as a [post on Quora](http://irondavy.quora.com/Applied-Discovery-Presentation-from-Build-2013), product designer David Cole observes that historically speaking, the term *design* has been misused, when discussing the creation of products. It has been relegated to surface ornamentation or marketing collateral, and conceptualized as being separate from the thing of value—the product—itself. In fact, the creation of the product, from vision to execution *is* design—product design. And product design is very similar to what has historically been understood as *invention*.

Cole then observes that many historically significant inventions haven’t  necessarily been the result of technological advancements. Many successful inventions are the result of identifying a need—a human, social, societal need—and using existing technologies to create a solution. His example is Twitter, which changed everyday communication for billions of people with the simple addition of a 140 character limit to a pre-existing form. He uses the term **applied discovery** to describe this phenomenon (invention decoupled from technological innovation). One of the more enjoyable passages in the essay relate the invention of basketball as an example of applied discovery—a hugely success game that was originally designed with pre-existing materials, based on concrete requirements.

He then discusses the importance of understanding that, for those of us who work in a technology-related filed, our work has value that goes beyond the technology itself, and the artefacts produced in the process of exploring it. For, web designers, there’s a common lament that our work is ephemeral and looks dated as the state of the art changes. I often struggle with the fact that my body of work will be less relevant with time. For interaction design, there isn’t really an equivalent of a monograph or exhibition that can as a record of experiments, failures and successes. As far as a tangible legacy goes, prospects are grim.

But Cole’s perspective is liberating. He observes that we interaction designers are fortunate; interaction design is about discovering new truths about humanity, and the knowledge gained is the true legacy. The websites and apps may expire, but we’re contributing to a new body of knowledge, and that knowledge outlives any physical (or virtual) artifact.

I take solace from this idea. As new technologies appear with increasing rapidity in all spheres of life, there will be a greater need for interaction design to translate the raw possibilities these technologies afford into human terms. We interaction designers can be an interpretive layer that weaves the new into the fabric of everyday life. To do so, we need to have a strong bedrock of interaction design principles and knowledge, and we have an opportunity to start building this body of knowledge the right way, right now, with an eye to the future.

Because, as Cole continues in his essay, the two greatest themes in the history of invention are empowerment and scale. The scale is rapidly expanding. It’s up to us to make sure we continue to minimize friction and make new technologies truly empowering.
